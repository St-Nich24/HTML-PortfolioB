<h1>Background & History</h1>
<p>I am a new Web Development professional who is looking to learn and grow with new opportunities that may come my way.
  Working within the government sector for the past five years has allowed me to enhance and expound upon my current skill set.
  I have over 10 years of work experience in leadership and training roles. 
</p>

<p>For the last 5 years I have worked OCONUS in both the Middle East and most currently now in Asia (Japan). I worked over 6,000 manned hours during the Covid-19 pandemic. 
  It was my preserverance, dedication, and discipline thought saw me through some of the most challenging and difficult moments of my lifetime thus far. </p>

<p>I'm truly grateful for the journey. This process of learning new skills and techniques has been challenging.
Thank you in advance to all who have supported me, and to even those I haven't met yet.
My purpose, desire, and dream is to provide for my family and to make them proud. Peace.
